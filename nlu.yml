    - Claims [22-23](claim_no) are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA), first paragraph, as failing to  comply with the written description requirement. The claim(s) contains subject matter which was not described in  the specification in such a way as to reasonably convey to one skilled in the relevant art that the inventor or a joint  inventor, or for pre-AIA the inventor(s), at the time the application was filed, had possession of the claimed  invention. Claim 22 and 23 (an independent claim which relies upon the subject matter of claim 22) set forth a €œnon-transitory computer program". While the originally filed specification may describe computer programs or even  computer-readable mediums that may be consider non-transitory such as a compact disc (CD) (Pages 15-16), the  original disclosure is completely silent on a non-transitory computer program and what is encompassed by such a  term. Thus, claims 22-23 fail to comply with the written description requirement.
    - Claim [46](claim_no) is rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over U.S. Patent Pub. [20130132502](patent_no) by [Stacey](inventor) et al in view of U.S. Patent Pub.

    - Claims [24-27](claim_no) are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is  directed to non-statutory subject matter. Claims [51 and 52](claim_no) recites a computer readable  medium which appears to cover both transitory and non-transitory embodiments. The  United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is required to give claims their  broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification during proceedings  before the USPTO. See In re Zletz, 893 F.2d 319 (Fed. Cir.1989) (during patent  examination the pending claims must be interpreted as broadly as their terms reasonably  allow). The broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim drawn to a computer readable  medium (also called machine readable medium and other such variations) typically  covers forms of non- transitory tangible media and transitory propagating signals per se  in view of the ordinary and customary meaning of computer readable media, particularly  when the specification is silent. See MPEP 2111.01. When the broadest reasonable  interpretation of a claim covers a signal per se, the claim must be rejected under 35  U.S.C. 101 as covering non-statutory subject matter. See In re Nuijiten, 500 F.3d  1346,1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (transitory embodiments are not directed to statutory  subject matter) and Interim Examination Instructions for Evaluating Subject Matter  eligibility Under 35 U.S.C 10, Aug. 24,2009:p.2.
    - Claims [1-20](claim_no) are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is directed to a judicial exception (i.e., a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea) without significantly  more. Based upon consideration of all of the relevant factors with respect to the claim as a whole, claims  [1-15](claim_no) are held to claim an abstract idea, and are therefore rejected as ineligible subject matter under 35  U.S.C. 101. The rationale for this finding is explained below.
    - Claims [13 and 23](claim_no) are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is directed to non-statutory subject matter. Claims [13 and 23](claim_no) do not fall within at least one of the four categories of  patent eligible subject matter because the claimed inventions are directed to €œsoftware per se and  €œcomputer program per se€ respectively. Suggestion is for the applicant to amend the claim to include  structural components to meet a definition of a machine. See MPEP 2106).
    - Claims [18-23 and 25](claim_no) are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as being anticipated  by [Jiang](inventor) (US [2005/0097222](patent_no)) With regard to Claim [18](claim_no), €œApparatus for implementation in a Session Initiated Protocol, SIP, operator domain in IP multimedia Subsystem, IMS, for managing SIP  user identities wherein each SIP user is identified by a SIP URI, the apparatus  comprising Jiang discloses an apparatus for mapping a variety of different identities  to a single SIP URI in a IMS network (See Figures 2 and 3 and paragraphs 4-7) €œa database (DDB) adapted to store and publish at least one identifier selected by the user, wherein the database (DDB) is accessible to a content manager (DCM),  adapted to associate the at least one selected identifier with the SIP URI of the user;€   Jiang discloses an apparatus for mapping a variety of different identities chosen by the  user to a single SIP URI (See Figures 2 items 215, 225, 235 and 245 and 3 and  paragraphs 4-7 and 19) €œand a search engine (DSE), adapted to search for a SIP URI in the database (DDB) via the associated published selected identifier and to act as an interface  between different SIP operator domains and adapted to forward a search request to  other operators€. Jiang discloses searching for the SIP URI in the database and  forwarding it to other databases so as to determine the correct SIP URI and route  (paragraph 21-22) With regard to Claim 19, €œThe apparatus of claim 1 wherein the apparatus is adapted to be accessed by the user via a web interface€. Jiang discloses the apparatus  to be accessed via a web interface (paragraphs 24,33-34) With regard to Claim 20, €œThe apparatus of claim 1 wherein the content manager (DCM) is arranged to check that the selected identifier is unique across the users of an  operator€. Jiang discloses that the selected identifiers are unique (paragraph 20)  furthermore it is implicit that such identifiers are unique for point to point  communication. With regard to Claim 21, €œThe apparatus of claim 18, wherein the content manager (DCM) is arranged to generate at least one internal identifier with alternative  spelling associated with the selected identifier. Jiang discloses that certain internal  identifiers can be associated with the SIP URI including postmaster or webmaster  (paragraph 24 and Figure 2 item 225).

An example of a network packet is a data packet, which  typically includes a header and a payload. The Fig. 5B shows  client system 520 in communication with server 570 via network  30 and packeting engine 500. The client 520 sends traffic  addressed to a service IP name, which a domain name server (DNS)  resolves to the service IP address W1. When it receives the  traffic, it routes the traffic to packeting engine 500.") of determining a downlink service path for a downlink packet ([0106], [0109], FIGS. 5-5J, In the loopback mode the server, 570, which is the provider, transmits back the packets to the client 520,  using the packeting engine 500.

    - Claims [1 -3, 5-13, and 15-20](claim_no) are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101, based on Alice- Mayo framework, because the claimed invention is directed to a judicial exception (i.e., a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea) without significantly more. For example, independent Claim [1](claim_no) is directed to an abstract idea of annotating a 3D image, dividing it into regions, performing a registration and map the 3D image to 2D image, and display the results of the analysis. The claim does not include additional elements that are sufficient to amount to significantly more than the judicial exception because the recited elements when considered both individually and as an ordered combination do not amount more than the abstract idea of capturing image data, analyzing the captured data and displaying the results of the analysis, similar to the concept that was determined by the courts to be patent ineligible In re Electric Power Group, LLC. In addition, it can be argued that the limitations of Claim 1 as recited may be performed as mental steps using a pen and paper. The recitation of structural elements, such as “image scanner”, or "a computer-readable memory/medium" (recited in independent Claim 11) is not considered to add “significantly more” than the abstract idea, because any one of these elements is recited at a high level of generality, which provides conventional computer functions that do not add meaningful limits to practicing the abstract idea. There is no indication that the combination of elements improves the functioning of a computer or improves any other technology. In addition, there is no recited transformation from one state to the next that may be considered as an additional element that will amount to “significantly more”. Furthermore, the recited elements are not tied to a specific technology or enhance the functionality of an existing system/method. Finally, recited elements within the other independent claim and the above-listed claims that are dependent from them, taken individually or in combination, do not amount to “significantly more” than just the abstract idea as previously identified above. Therefore, the claims do not amount to significantly more than the previously described abstract idea.
